<p>This file can be an extra source of information on vegetation maps.</p>

<p>I am still thinking about how best to write and store these helpfiles. This one is written in html, probably better to write in markdown.</p>

<p>Default vegetation types (you may recognise the image! I can try to improve the quality of the copy):</p>

<p>A <b>vegetation map file</b> needs to be saved as a space delimited text file with the suffix <b>'.txt'</b> and a grid of single letters from the codes DTOSBGN. At the very simplest: D D would define a map of 2 cells of vegetation code D. The default names for the codes are : "Dense Forest","Thicket","Open Forest","Savannah","Bush","Grass","No-go area". These names can be changed, either in an attribute file (see below) or in the user interface.</p>

<p>An optional <b>attribute file</b> needs to be saved as a comma delimited text file with the suffix <b>'.csv'</b>. It needs to consist of 3 columns. The first should contain the vegetation codes, the 2nd column should contain corresponding names for each code. Subsequent columns will be used to determine fly behaviour in each vegetation type.</p>
